<time class="metadata" style="text-alstyleign:left"> Guides • Finance &amp; Accounting • 05/07/2019</time>

<h2 class="colored-magenta" id="ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers">IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers</h2>

<p>IFRS 15 replaces both IAS 11 and IAS 18 as well as SIC 31, IFRIC 13, IFRIC 15 and IFRIC 18 and establishes a single, comprehensive framework for revenue recognition.</p>

<p>The objective of IFRS 15 is to establish the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer.</p>

<h2 class="colored-magenta" id="definition-of-income">Definition of income</h2>

<p>Income is an in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of inflows or enhancements of assets or decreases of liabilities that result in an increase in equity, other than those relating to contributions from equity participants.</p>

<h2 class="colored-magenta" id="core-principle">Core principle</h2>

<p>Its core principle is that revenue is recognised to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.</p>

<p>Revenue is recognised when an entity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. However, a good or service is only considered transferred when the customer obtains control of that good or service.</p>

<p>Usually the following criteria will be met:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A contract has been agreed between the parties. This may be orally, in writing or otherwise;</li>
  <li>The value of the goods or services has been established;</li>
  <li>The product or service has been provided to the buyer (control has transferred);</li>
  <li>The buyer has indicated willingness to hand over cash or other assets in settlement.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="colored-magenta" id="measurement">Measurement</h2>

<p>Revenue should be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price) per IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.</p>

<h2 class="colored-magenta" id="performance-obligations">Performance obligations</h2>

<p>A promise in a contract with a customer to transfer to the customer either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct; or</li>
  <li>A series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="colored-magenta" id="five-step-approach">Five step approach</h2>

<p>IFRS 15 uses a five step model for the recognition of revenue.</p>

<ol class="numbered-list">
  <li>Identify the contract(s) with a customer</li>
  <li>Identify the performance obligations in the contract</li>
  <li>Determine the transaction price</li>
  <li>Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract</li>
  <li>Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation</li>
</ol>

<p>Application will depend on the facts and circumstances present in a contract with a customer and will require the exercise of judgment.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-identify-the-contract-with-the-customer">Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer</h3>

<p>A contract with a customer will be within the scope of IFRS 15 if all the following conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The contract has been approved by the parties to the contract;</li>
  <li>Each party’s rights in relation to the goods or services to be transferred can be identified;</li>
  <li>The payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred can be identified;</li>
  <li>The contract has commercial substance; and</li>
  <li>It is probable that the consideration to which the entity is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services will be collected.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a contract with a customer does not yet meet all of the above criteria, the entity will continue to re-assess the contract going forward to determine whether it subsequently meets the above criteria. From that point, the entity will apply IFRS 15 to the contract.</p>

<p>A contract need not be in writing, as a valid contract can be oral or implied. The key requirements are that the contract has commercial substance, identifieseach party’s rights and makes clear the payment terms. It  must be probable that the consideration(payment) will be collected.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-identify-the-performance-obligations-in-the-contract">Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract</h3>

<p>This refers to whatever the seller is obliged to do under the contract. The performance obligation may be single or multiple depending on the situation. A straightforward retail sale of goods is an example of a single obligation. Once the seller provides the goods to the buyer, it has satisfied its performance obligation.</p>

<p>Sometimes a contract may have multiple performance obligations. An example here is a seller that agrees to supply and install a heating system for a customer. The supply of the goods is one deliverable, and the installation of the system is another. Each portion capable of being sold separately must be identified.</p>

<p>At the inception of the contract, the entity should assess the goods or services that have been promised to the customer, and identify as a performance obligation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A good or service (or bundle of goods or services) that is distinct; or</li>
  <li>A series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following are examples of circumstances which do not give rise to a performance obligation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Providing goods at scrap value</li>
  <li>Activities relating to internal administrative contract set-up</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="series-of-goods-or-services"><span style="color:#ed2c09">Series of Goods or Services</span></h4>

<p>A series of distinct goods or services is transferred to the customer in the same pattern if both of the following criteria are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each distinct good or service in the series that the entity promises to transfer consecutively to the customer would be a performance obligation that is satisfied over time (see below); and</li>
  <li>A single method of measuring progress would be used to measure the entity’s progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation to transfer each distinct good or service in the series to the customer.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="distinct-goods-or-services"><span style="color:#ed2c09">Distinct Goods or Services</span></h4>

<p>A good or service is distinct if both of the following criteria are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The customer can benefit from the good or services on its own or in conjunction with other readily available resources; and</li>
  <li>The entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately idenitifable from other promises in the contract - goods or services offered are not integrated or dependent on other goods or services provided already under the contract; the obligation provides goods or services rather than only modifies goods or services already provided</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="unbundling"><span style="color:#ed2c09">Unbundling</span></h4>

<p>Unbundling a contract may apply when incentives are offered at the time of sale, such as free servicing or enhanced warranties. In this case servicing and warranties are performance obligations that are distinct and revenue relating to them needs to be recognised separately from the goods or services promised on the contract to which they relate.</p>

<p>Circumstances which could result in contracts being combined:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective</li>
  <li>Consideration for one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract</li>
</ul>

<p>Factors for consideration as to whether a promise to transfer goods or services to the customer is not separately identifiable include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The entity does provide a significant service of integrating the goods or services with other goods or services promised in the contract;</li>
  <li>The goods or services significantly modify or customise other goods or services promised in the contract;</li>
  <li>The goods or services are highly interrelated or highly interdependent.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-3-determine-the-transaction-price">Step 3: Determine the transaction price</h3>

<p>Normally the agreed price is clear from the agreement. It should be taken to be the fair value (at the transaction date) of the consideration expected to be received. If there are uncertainties, the transaction price should be estimated using probabilities. The price should be considered net of VAT, trade discounts and rebates (but is not net of settlement discounts).</p>

<p>If there are delayed payment terms agreed to one year or more, the provision of credit is considered an additional deliverable, and separated from the supply of goods by discounting the amount receivable to present value.</p>

<p>The transaction price is the amount to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods and services. When making this determination, an entity will consider past customary business practices.</p>

<h4 id="variable-consideration"><span style="color:#ed2c09">Variable Consideration<span></span></span></h4>

<p>Where a contract contains elements of variable consideration, the entity will estimate the amount of variable consideration to which it will be entitled under the contract. Variable consideration can arise, for example, as a result of discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties or other similar items. Variable consideration is also present if an entity’s right to consideration is contingent on the occurrence of a future event.</p>

<p>The standard deals with the uncertainty relating to variable consideration by limiting the amount of variable consideration that can be recognised. Specifically, variable consideration is only included in the transaction price if, and to the extent that, it is highly probable that its inclusion will not result in a significant revenue reversal in the future when the uncertainty has been subsequently resolved.</p>

<p>However, a different, more restrictive approach is applied in respect of sales or usage-based royalty revenue arising from licences of intellectual property. Such revenue is recognised only when the underlying sales or usage occur.</p>

<p>Variable consideration is measured by reference to two methods</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expected value for the contract portfolio (for a large number of contracts), or</li>
  <li>Single most likely outcome amount (if there are only two potential outcomes)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="time-value-of-money"><span style="color:#ed2c09">Time Value of Money</span></h4>

<p>Adjustments for the effects of the time value of money (a ‘financing component’):</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a financing component is significant, IFRS 15 requires an adjustment to be made for the effect of implicit financing
    <ul>
      <li>Cash received in advance from buyer – vendor to recognise finance cost and increase in deferred revenue</li>
      <li>Cash received in arrears from buyer – vendor to recognise finance income and reduction in revenue</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No adjustment for a financing component is needed if payment is settled within one year of goods or services transferred</p>
  </li>
  <li>The following do not give rise to a financing component (and hence no adjustment is needed):
    <ul>
      <li>Customer has discretion over the timing of the transfer of control of the goods or services</li>
      <li>Consideration is variable and the amount or timing depends on factors outside of parties’ control</li>
      <li>The difference between the consideration and cash selling price arises for other non-financing reasons (ie performance protection)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-4-allocate-the-transaction-price-to-the-performance-obligations-in-the-contracts">Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contracts</h3>

<p>This step is only relevant if multiple deliverables exist in the contract. If there is only one deliverable, the entire price is allocated to that. If there are multiple deliverables, the transaction price is allocated to the deliverables in the ratio of the standalone selling prices of each individual deliverable as at the contract date.</p>

<p>Where a contract has multiple performance obligations, an entity will allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract by reference to their relative standalone selling prices.</p>

<p>If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, the entity will need to estimate it. IFRS 15 suggests various methods that might be used, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adjusted market assessment approach</li>
  <li>Expected cost plus a margin approach</li>
  <li>Residual approach (only permissible in limited circumstances)</li>
</ul>

<p>Any overall discount compared to the aggregate of standalone selling prices is allocated between performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain circumstances, it may be appropriate to allocate such a discount to some but not all of the performance obligations.</p>

<p>Where consideration is paid in advance or in arrears, the entity will need to consider whether the contract includes a significant financing arrangement and, if so, adjust for the time value of money. A practical expedient is available where the interval between transfer of the promised goods or services and payment by the customer is expected to be less than 12 months.</p>

<h3 id="step-5-recognise-revenue-when-or-as-the-entity-satisfies-a-performance-obligation">Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation</h3>

<p>A performance obligation is normally deemed to be satisfied when control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The point of revenue recognition is the point when performance obligation is satisfied, per each distinctive obligation</li>
  <li>May result in revenue recognition at a point in time or over time</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="control-of-an-asset"><span style="color:#ed2c09">Control of an Asset</span></h4>

<p>Control of an asset is defined as the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the asset. This includes the ability to prevent others from directing the use of and obtaining the benefits from the asset. The benefits related to the asset are the potential cash flows that may be obtained directly or indirectly. These include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using the asset to produce goods or provide services;</li>
  <li>Using the asset to enhance the value of other assets;</li>
  <li>Using the asset to settle liabilities or to reduce expenses;</li>
  <li>Selling or exchanging the asset;</li>
  <li>Pledging the asset to secure a loan; and</li>
  <li>Holding the asset</li>
</ul>

<p>The following events can indicate that control has been transferred:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The entity has a present right to payment for the asset</li>
  <li>The customer has legal title to the asset</li>
  <li>The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset</li>
  <li>The significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer</li>
  <li>The customer has accepted the asset</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="revenue-over-time"><span style="color:#ed2c09">Revenue over time</span></h4>

<p>An entity recognises revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The customer simultaneously receives and consumes all of the benefits provided by the entity as the entity performs;</li>
  <li>The entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created; or</li>
  <li>The entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="revenue-at-point-in-time"><span style="color:#ed2c09">Revenue at point in time</span></h4>

<p>If an entity does not satisfy its performance obligation over time, it satisfies it at a point in time. Revenue will therefore be recognised when control is passed at a certain point in time. Factors that may indicate the point in time at which control passes include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The entity has a present right to payment for the asset;</li>
  <li>The customer has legal title to the asset;</li>
  <li>The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset;</li>
  <li>The customer has the significant risks and rewards related to the ownership of the asset; and</li>
  <li>The customer has accepted the asset.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="recognising-revenue-over-time"><span style="color:#ed2c09">Recognising revenue over time</span></h4>

<p>To the extent that each of the performance obligations has been satisfied. This can be established using two methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Output method</em> - direct measurement of the value of goods or services transferred to date for example per surveys of completion to date, appraisals of results achieved, milestones reached, units produced/delivered; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Input method</em> - based on measures such as resources consumed, costs incurred (but see below re contract set up costs), number of hours per time sheets or machine hours, which are directly related to the vendor’s performance</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Contract set up activities and preparatory tasks necessary to fulfil a contract do not form part of revenue, and may meet capital recognition asset requirement</p>

<h2 class="colored-magenta" id="contract-costs">Contract costs</h2>

<p>The incremental costs of <strong>obtaining</strong> a contract must be <strong>recognised as an asset</strong> if the entity expects to recover those costs. However, those incremental costs are limited to the costs that the entity would not have incurred if the contract had not been successfully obtained (e.g. ‘success fees’ paid to agents).</p>

<p>A practical expedient is available, allowing the incremental costs of obtaining a contract to be expensed if the associated amortisation period would be 12 months or less.</p>

<p>Costs incurred to fulfil a contract are recognised as an asset if and only if all of the following criteria are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The costs relate directly to a contract (or a specific anticipated contract);</li>
  <li>The costs generate  or enhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future; and</li>
  <li>The costs are expected to be recovered.</li>
</ul>

<p>These include costs such as direct labour, direct materials, and the allocation of overheads that relate directly to the contract.</p>

<p>The asset recognised in respect of the costs to obtain or fulfil a contract is amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer of the goods or services to which the asset relates.</p>

<h2 class="colored-magenta" id="other-topics">Other topics</h2>

<p>The standard also includes implementation guidance on other areas, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Performance obligations satisfied over time</li>
  <li>Methods for measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation</li>
  <li>Sale with a right of return</li>
  <li>Warranties</li>
  <li>Principal versus agent considerations</li>
  <li>Customer options for additional goods or services</li>
  <li>Customers’ unexercised rights</li>
  <li>Non-refundable upfront fees</li>
  <li>Licensing</li>
  <li>Repurchase arrangements</li>
  <li>Consignment arrangements</li>
  <li>Bill-and-hold arrangements</li>
  <li>Customer acceptance</li>
  <li>Disclosures of disaggregation of revenue</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="colored-magenta" id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Selling costs directly incurred in earning a sales contract are capitalised and recognised over the period revenue from that contract is recognised. Example – sales commission paid to an agent by a phone company for securing a 12-month phone service contract.</li>
  <li>Goods expected to be returned are not to be recognised as revenue. An estimate should be made of the amount expected to be returned.</li>
  <li>A  warranty  is  often a separate  deliverable in a sales contract. As such it is treated as a component of the deal. The revenue is separated, and the portion relating to the warranty is recognised over the warranty period. If the warranty is inseparable from the goods supplied (i.e. if cost information is not separately available), then a provision should be made under IAS 37, as was the previous practice for all warranties.</li>
  <li>If goods are sold as agent rather than as principal, only the commission receivable is recognised as revenue. For example, if an estate agent sells a house on behalf of a client for £300,000, earning 1.5% commission. The revenue of the agent is £4,500, not £300,000.</li>
  <li>If cash is received in advance of supply, the amount is credited to a deferred revenue account, and carried as a liability in the statement of financial position. The liability is transferred to revenue when the performance obligation is met. This is the case even if the cash received is non-refundable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="colored-magenta" id="disclosures">Disclosures</h2>

<p>The disclosure objective stated in IFRS 15 is for an entity to disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Therefore, an entity should disclose qualitative and quantitative information about all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Its contracts with customers;</li>
  <li>The significant judgments, and changes in the judgments, made in applying the guidance to those contracts; and</li>
  <li>Any assets recognised from the costs to obtain or fulfil a contract with a customer</li>
</ul>

<p>Entities will need to consider the level of detail necessary to satisfy the disclosure objective and how much emphasis to place on each of the requirements. An entity should aggregate or disaggregate disclosures to ensure that useful information is not obscured.</p>
